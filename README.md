# ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!

My name is Jory Tindall, I'm a product designer and design technologist specializing in design systems, currently building the [Helios Design System](https://helios.hashicorp.design) with a dedicated team of product designers and developers.

You might also find me performing as a saxophonist in Seattle and the Pacific Northwest and teaching the next generation of shredders. If you're interested in music and music education, check out [Downbeat Academy](https://downbeatacademy.com), a growing resource for students, musicians, and educators.

This monorepo is managed by `pnpm` workspaces and TurboRepo and contains:

-   My [personal website](https://jorytindall.com) for design, development, and music, built with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/).
-   The content management system for my website built with [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/).
-   Tokens managed with `style-dictionary`

There are a couple of projects that are a work-in-progress to add some additional content and functionality to my personal suite of web platforms, including:

- A custom REST API for managing my resume items and work history.
- A growing collection of presentations geared towards conference talks and education around design systems and bridging the gap between designers and engineers; built with a unique configuration of [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [RevealJS](https://revealjs.com/).

Everything deploys to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
