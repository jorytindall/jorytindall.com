# ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!

My name is Jory Tindall, I'm a product designer and design technologist specializing in design systems, currently building the [HashiCorp Design System](https://github.com/hashicorp/design-system) with a dedicated team of product designers and developers.

You might also find me performing as a saxophonist in Seattle and the Pacific Northwest and teaching the next generation of shredders. If you're interested in music and music education, check out [Downbeat Academy](https://downbeatacademy.com), a growing resource for students, musicians, and educators.

This is a monorepo managed by yarn workspaces and TurboRepo that contains:

-   My personal website for design, development, and music, built with NextJS
-   The content management system for my website built with Sanity
