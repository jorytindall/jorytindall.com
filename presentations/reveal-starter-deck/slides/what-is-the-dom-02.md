## What is the DOM?

**Document Object Model (DOM):** the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. ([Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction))

<ul>
  <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">The logical semantic tree structure of an HTML document</li>
  <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">Can be styled to change the visual appearance</li>
  <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">Can be used with JavaScript to add interactivity</li>
</ul>

Notes:
When we're in the world of single page applications and JavaScript frameworks things can get a bit complicated, but that's a story for another day.
