We still live in a world where designers and developers easily misunderstand each other. We also live in a world where design systems can be powerful aids in increasing the velocity of product implementation. In this talk, we'll go through our component process from start to finish, and outline places where we have specifically worked to bridge the gap not only between the designers and developers on our team, but designer and developer teams throughout the company as well.
