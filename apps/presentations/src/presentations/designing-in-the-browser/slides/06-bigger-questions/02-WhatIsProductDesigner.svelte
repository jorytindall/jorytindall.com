		<p>So, let's bring back this question. What does "product designer" even mean now?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				I've always defined a designer as someone who solves problems through design
				thinking and deep understanding of the problem space
			</li>
			<li>
				In a corporate setting, that's manifested as someone who creates UI designs in a
				design tool
			</li>
			<li>But we're on the cusp of designers shaking off the handcuffs of design tooling</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The title is due for a refresh:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				With a little technical knowledge, a paired AI tool, and some creative thinking, the
				term "designer" is set for a refresh
			</li>
			<li>
				There's also a risk: firms that maintain a strict view of what a designer "is" will
				fall behind
			</li>
			<li>
				Those that embrace a more flexible description will reap the rewards of moving
				design closer to users
			</li>
		</ul>
