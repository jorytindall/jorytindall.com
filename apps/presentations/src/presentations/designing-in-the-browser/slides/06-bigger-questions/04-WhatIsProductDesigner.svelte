		<ul>
			<li>I've always defined a designer as someone who solves problems</li>
			<li>Through design thinking and deep understanding of the problem space</li>
			<li>In corporate settings, that's manifested as someone who creates UI designs in a design tool</li>
			<li>But we're on the cusp of designers shaking off the handcuffs of design tooling</li>
