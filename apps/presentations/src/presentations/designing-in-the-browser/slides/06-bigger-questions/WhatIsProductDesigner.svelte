	<Notes>
		<p>I've always defined a designer as someone who solves problems — through design thinking and deep understanding of the problem space. In corporate settings, that's manifested as someone who creates UI designs in a design tool. But we're on the cusp of designers shaking off the handcuffs of design tooling.</p>
