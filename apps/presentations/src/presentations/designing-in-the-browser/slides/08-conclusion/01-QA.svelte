	<Notes>
		<p>Open it up for Q&amp;A. Be prepared for questions like:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Tools and workflows:</strong> "What specific tools do you use?" — Browser
				DevTools, VS Code/Cursor, local dev environment, AI assistants like Claude.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Pushback on premise:</strong> "Isn't this just for design engineers?" — No,
				this is about expanding your skillset and getting closer to the final product. The
				level of depth is up to you.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Time investment:</strong> "How long does it take to learn?" — Start with
				DevTools today, basic HTML/CSS in a few weeks, local development in a few months. It's
				a gradual process.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Team dynamics:</strong> "How do engineers feel about this?" — In my
				experience, engineers appreciate designers who understand the medium and can speak
				their language.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Thank everyone for their time and remind them of the key takeaway: start small, stay
			curious, and embrace the hybrid workflow.
