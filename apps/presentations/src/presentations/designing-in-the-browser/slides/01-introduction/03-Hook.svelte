		<p>
			To kick us off I'll pose a question: "what does the term 'product
			designer' even mean anymore?" Our industry is going through a
			significant shift right now, different values are being placed on
			designers and engineers.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The tools are changing, AI is injected everywhere in our process
				whether we like it or not.
			</li>
			<li>
				The processes we use to design and build software are evolving
				in parallel with these tools.
			</li>
			<li>The boundaries between design and engineering are blurring.</li>
			<li>
				More broadly, the tech industry is consolidating. I'm not sure
				if you've heard of the recent large acquisitions of a company
				called IBM. This consolidation impacts the logistics around our
				roles, where we fit in the corporate hierarchy, and the value
				propositions we're required to deliver on.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			I've mentioned AI a couple times already, and I think it's important
			to note that while AI is a significant driver of change in our
			industry right now, it's not the sole focus of this talk.
		</p>
		<p>
			Instead, I want to focus on how we as designers can navigate this
			volatility by adopting a more "realistic" process to designing a UI,
			crafting an experience that brings us closer to our users, and
			reduces our dependence on tools and trends that may not serve us
			well in the long run.
