		But more importantly, <em>why</em> does this talk exist?
		<ul>
			<li>
				Even though design tooling has made significant advances in
				recent years, communication between designers and engineers is
				still challenging.
			</li>
			<li>
				As tooling evolves, shifting between a design and engineering
				mindset (even in a basic sense) helps to better communicate
				design intent.
			</li>
			<li>
				Understanding what how an engineering partner is going to
				implement something helps us as designers to more effectively
				hand-off our designs and ship better products and experiences.
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>Controversial take:</em> <strong>Everybody</strong> is responsible
				for the experience, we just contribute differently to the resulting
				UX. Design is about solving problems, each discipline solves problems
				differently, but we all contribute to the end result to solve a user
				need and problem.
			</li>
